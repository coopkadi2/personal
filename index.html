        <p><strong>Welcome.</strong> This website serves as the creative portfolio and external 
        archive for myself: Cooper Kadish. It documents the entirety of my creative work across 
        various disciplines, including architecture, art, and design. Conceived as both a repository 
        as well as an extension of my practice, this site blurs the boundaries between presence 
        and privacy.
        <br/>
        The ethos of this digital space lies in its intentional opacity; it deposes the forwardness 
        of online portfolios, social media, and other forms of publication that are designed to gain 
        visibility through algorithms and mass-exposure rather than the genuine interest of others.
        <br/>
        The design of the site stems from the tactile experience of sifting through a filing cabinet. 
        Interactions are meant to be lengthened; each choice deliberately exposes specific content.
        <br/>
        Ultimately, this website is more than a portfolio - it is a testament to my philosophy of creation and
        the inspiration to do so. It affirms that not all work demands to be seen by everyone, and it hopes to illustrate how sometimes
        the most meaningful discoveries can arise in the stillness of what is hidden.</p>
