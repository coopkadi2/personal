                I began shooting film photography during the summer of 2023, while living in Brooklyn, New York. 
                Inspired by an essay I had written the semester prior regarding the discourse surrounding film 
                photography communities, I felt compelled to engage with the medium myself.
                <br/>
                Much of my experience so far has been shaped by the process of acclimating to analog photography—
                navigating the uncertainty of old cameras, learning to work with film’s inherent limitations, and 
                striving to consistently create images that are compelling.
                <br/>
                Lately, my focus has shifted toward investigating what differentiates a photograph from a work of art. 
                I am drawn to the idea that art, much like architecture, is successful when the leveraging of a concept 
                is coherent and approachable. In this spirit, I aspire for my photography to function as a kind of visual 
                parti-diagram for the human experience—a distillation of emotion, memory, and place.
                <br/>
                As I continue this exploration, I aim to refine my methods and deepen my understanding of context and its 
                impact, shifting my focus from novelty to the essence of my environment and lived experience. I am 
                captivated by images that feel simultaneously familiar and unseen, evoking both nostalgia and emotion. By 
                grounding my practice in this way, I hope to inspire others to appreciate the minutiae of daily life and 
                discover the romance in experiences often left unrecognized.
