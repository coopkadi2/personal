            <p>The ethos of this digital space lies in its intentional opacity. It resists the ubiquity 
                of online portfolios designed to gain visibility through algorithms and metrics. Instead, 
                it exists as a quiet sanctuary, accessible only to those who actively seek it out. This 
                deliberate restraint reflects my belief that meaningful engagement arises not from mass 
                exposure but from intentional exploration or emotional resonance.

                This website's design evokes the tactile experience of sifting through a filing cabinet, 
                translated into a digital medium. Each interaction unfolds gradually, contributing to the 
                eventual revelation of content.</p>
